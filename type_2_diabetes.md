## Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance and progressive pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. In Canada, approximately 8.9% of adults live with diabetes. This review examines the biological foundations of T2D and the systemic challenges, particularly wait times, that influence clinical outcomes in the Canadian healthcare system.

## Biological Foundations
* **Insulin Resistance:** A hallmark of early T2D where tissues like skeletal muscle and the liver fail to take up glucose effectively despite normal insulin levels.
* **β-Cell Failure:** Over time, the demand for insulin leads to cellular stress, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity, which eventually cause β-cell apoptosis and reduced insulin output.
* **Complications:** Chronic hyperglycemia leads to microvascular issues (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular risks, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

## The Impact of Wait Times in Canada
* **Specialist Access:** More than one-third of Canadians report waiting three months or more for a specialist referral.
* **Treatment Delays:** Research shows Canadians with T2D wait nearly two years on average to intensify therapy with a second agent, compared to under one year in the United States.
* **Clinical Consequences:** These delays prolong exposure to high glucose levels, accelerating the progression of complications and β-cell decline.

## Potential Solutions
To improve patient outcomes, the following strategies are proposed:
* **Virtual Care:** Using eConsult platforms to give primary care providers quick access to specialist advice.
* **Task-Sharing:** Empowering nurse practitioners and diabetes educators to manage routine monitoring and medication adjustments.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Using data to identify and prioritize high-risk patients for early intervention.
