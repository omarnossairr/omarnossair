# Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy
**A Practical Programming Framework based on Evidence (2020-2024)**

[Read full PDF here](hypertrophy.pdf)

## The Programming Strategy
A highly efficient hypertrophy program should emphasize quality over quantity, capturing the growth stimulus while minimizing wasted work.

## Key Training Variables
* **Volume:** Training volume is the most robust predictor of hypertrophic gains. An intermediate-to-high volume strategy (~12–20 sets/week) is generally optimal.
* **Effort & Proximity to Failure:** The "effective reps" model proposes that the final repetitions before technical failure confer the greatest stimulus for growth.
* **Proposed Framework:** Perform two working sets per muscle per session, taken to or very near failure, across 2–3 sessions per week.

## Summary Table
| Variable | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weekly Volume** | 12–20 sets per muscle |
| **Session Frequency** | 2–3 times per week |
| **Proximity to Failure** | 0–1 Reps in Reserve (RIR) |
