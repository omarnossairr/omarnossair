# Global Disparities in Access to Healthcare
**Coverage, Costs, Workforce Distribution, and a Canada-Focused Case Study**

## Abstract
Access to appropriate, timely, and affordable healthcare remains uneven across the globe despite international commitments to Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Disparities in service availability, financial protection, and healthcare workforce distribution continue to shape health outcomes across regions.

## Key Findings
* **Global Inequities:** While high-income regions demonstrate better coverage, low-income regions face critical shortages in healthcare workers and high financial barriers.
* **Service Coverage:** Despite progress, an estimated 4.6 billion people worldwide lack access to essential health services.
* **Workforce Crisis:** Over 55% of countries have fewer than 20 physicians per 10,000 people.

## The Canada Case Study
Canada, despite high healthcare spending, experiences significant challenges within its universal system:
* **Wait Times:** The median wait from GP referral to treatment exceeds 28 weeks.
* **Primary Care:** Nearly 20% of Canadians lack a regular primary care provider.
* **System Efficiency:** Universal coverage alone is insufficient without strong system capacity and equitable resource distribution.

## Conclusions
Achieving equitable healthcare access requires integrated strategies addressing workforce shortages, financial protection, and region-specific policy reform.
