# Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
**Current Evidence & Realistic Potential for Physicians and Surgeons**

## Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in clinical medicine, especially in diagnostic imaging, interventional radiology, and surgical robotics. AI is best viewed as a support tool: augmenting, not replacing, clinicians.

## Clinical Applications
* **Diagnostic Radiology:** AI algorithms often reach diagnostic performance comparable to, and sometimes better than, human experts in complex pattern recognition tasks.
* **Surgical Robotics:** AI-augmented robotic systems and computer-vision tools may enhance precision, planning, and intraoperative support.
* **Interventional Radiology:** AI applications range from lesion detection and segmentation to catheter navigation and image reconstruction.

## Challenges & Limits
Many applications remain experimental due to challenges such as:
* Data quality and generalizability.
* Lack of transparency ("Black Box" decision-making).
* Difficulties in integration into existing clinical workflows.
