## 🔬 About Me
I specialize in synthesizing complex medical and physiological data into actionable insights. My work explores the intersection of healthcare systems, emerging technology like AI, and the mechanics of human performance. This blog serves as a repository for my formal literature reviews and research summaries.

## 📚 Featured Literature Reviews

### 1. Global Disparities in Access to Healthcare
**Focus:** Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the Canadian Case Study.
* [cite_start]**The Gap:** Despite a global Service Coverage Index (SCI) of 71, approximately 4.6 billion people lack essential services[cite: 15, 36].
* [cite_start]**Workforce Crisis:** Over 55% of countries have fewer than 20 physicians per 10,000 people[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]**The Canadian Context:** Canada ranks near the bottom among peer countries for physician availability [cite: 62][cite_start], with a median wait time from GP referral to treatment exceeding 28 weeks[cite: 70].
* [cite_start]**Key Solutions:** Expanding the healthcare workforce and accelerating credential recognition for internationally trained professionals[cite: 82, 84].

### 2. AI in Medicine: Evidence for Physicians & Surgeons
**Focus:** Diagnostic accuracy and surgical robotics.
* [cite_start]**Diagnostics:** AI algorithms are reaching performance levels comparable to human experts in pattern recognition for radiology[cite: 154, 155].
* [cite_start]**Surgery:** AI-enhanced robots offer improved imaging support and sensor-based feedback[cite: 171].
* [cite_start]**Current Limits:** While promising, AI is currently a "co-pilot" rather than a replacement due to challenges in real-time navigation and "black box" decision-making[cite: 177, 219, 244].

### 3. Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy: A Programming Framework
**Focus:** Optimizing training volume, frequency, and effort.
* [cite_start]**Volume:** 12–20 sets per muscle per week is the "sweet spot" for most[cite: 283, 316].
* [cite_start]**Frequency:** Training a muscle 2–3 times per week is superior to once per week when volume is equated[cite: 287, 290].
* [cite_start]**Effort:** Proximity to failure (0–1 Reps in Reserve) provides a disproportionate stimulus for growth[cite: 321, 327].
* [cite_start]**Recommendation:** Perform 2 sets to near-failure per muscle group across 2–3 sessions per week[cite: 330, 331].

## 🛠 Skills & Expertise
* [cite_start]**Secondary Data Analysis:** Public datasets (WHO, World Bank, OECD)[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Medical Writing:** Evidence-based reviews and systematic synthesis[cite: 141, 273].
* [cite_start]**Clinical Knowledge:** Diagnostic imaging, surgical robotics, and primary care workflows[cite: 140, 163].
* [cite_start]**Physiology:** Resistance training variables and metabolic health adaptations[cite: 263, 273].
